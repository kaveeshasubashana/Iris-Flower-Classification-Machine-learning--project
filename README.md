# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Prediction Web App

A machine learning project that predicts the species of an Iris flower using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), deployed as a Flask web application.

## ðŸ”¹ About Iris Flowers

The Iris flower is a popular flower used in machine learning datasets because it has clear differences between species while being easy to measure.

Species in the dataset:

Iris-setosa â€“ Small flowers with short petals, usually bright white or violet.

Iris-versicolor â€“ Medium-sized flowers with colorful petals, often blue or purple.

Iris-virginica â€“ Large flowers with long petals, typically violet-blue.

## Features measured in the dataset:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

These measurements allow a machine learning model to distinguish between the three species accurately.

# ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Concepts
## 1. Supervised Learning

This project uses supervised learning, where:

The algorithm learns from labeled data (features + target labels).

Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width

Target: Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

The model learns patterns in the data and predicts the species for new, unseen flowers.

## 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

KNN is a simple but powerful algorithm for classification:

## How it works:

For a new flower, KNN finds the K nearest neighbors in the training dataset.

It calculates the distance (Euclidean or other metrics) between the new flower and all training points.

Predicts the species based on the majority class among the K neighbors.

## Key points:

Non-parametric: KNN does not assume any data distribution.

Lazy learning: KNN stores training data and computes predictions at runtime.

Hyperparameters: K (number of neighbors) and distance metric can be tuned for best performance.

## Advantages:

Simple and intuitive.

Works well on small datasets with clear patterns.

## Limitations:

Can be slow for large datasets.

Sensitive to irrelevant features and feature scaling.

## 3. Model Training

Trained on the classic Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features).

Used GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters (n_neighbors, weights, algorithm).

Model saved using pickle (predictor.pickle) for deployment in Flask.

# ðŸ”¹ Web Application

Built using Flask (Python).

Users can input:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Model predicts and displays the species of the Iris flower instantly.
